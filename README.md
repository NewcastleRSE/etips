eTIPS - Early Therapy in Perinatal Stroke

## About

eTIPS is a home based parent-delivered intervention for babies affected by perinatal stroke, developed by a team at Newcastle University and made possible by an NIHR Career Development Fellowship to Dr Anna Basu. Families involved are given developmental resources relevant to their baby's condition and additional support and advice throughout.
